        <h1>The Gap Between Approaches</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Feature extraction gets you 63%. Fine-tuning gets you 92%. That gap is not a rounding error.</p>

        <article>
<p>Feature extraction gets you 63% accuracy. Fine-tuning gets you 92%.</p>
<p>That's not a rounding error. That's the difference between "better than random" and "ready to ship."</p>
<h2>Two Ways to Use a Pretrained Model</h2>
<p>When you load a transformer like DistilBERT, you have two options:</p>
<p><strong>Feature extraction:</strong> Freeze the model, use its hidden states as features for a simple classifier (like logistic regression). Fast. Works without GPU. Hidden states computed once.</p>
<p><strong>Fine-tuning:</strong> Train the whole model end-to-end. The transformer adapts to your task. Slower. Needs GPU. Much better results.</p>
<p>The chapter demonstrates this with emotion classification on tweets (6 classes: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise).</p>
<p><strong>Feature extraction results:</strong>
- Accuracy: 63.3%
- Baseline (always guess most frequent class): 35%
- Conclusion: Better than random, but not great</p>
<p><strong>Fine-tuning results:</strong>
- Accuracy: 92.25%
- F1 score: 92.26%
- Conclusion: Production-ready</p>
<p>The gap is <strong>29 percentage points</strong>. That's not incremental improvement. That's a different category of performance.</p>
<h2>Why Feature Extraction Exists</h2>
<p>If fine-tuning is so much better, why bother with feature extraction?</p>
<p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Not everyone has GPUs. Not every task justifies the compute cost. Not every team can wait hours for training.</p>
<p>Feature extraction is the compromise:
- You get <em>some</em> benefit from the pretrained model
- Without the cost of full fine-tuning
- Good for quick experiments before committing to full training</p>
<p>Think of it as the prototype stage. You're testing whether transformers help at all before investing in the real thing.</p>
<h2>What Fine-Tuning Actually Does</h2>
<p>The key difference: <strong>adaptation</strong>.</p>
<p>Feature extraction assumes DistilBERT's hidden states (trained on masked language modeling) are good enough for your task. Sometimes they're not.</p>
<p>Fine-tuning lets the model <strong>adjust</strong> those hidden states to minimize loss on <em>your</em> classification task. The representations shift during training to better separate your classes.</p>
<p>The chapter shows this visually with UMAP projections of the hidden states. Before fine-tuning, emotions like sadness, anger, and fear overlap significantly. The model can't separate them well because it was never trained to.</p>
<p>After fine-tuning, the boundaries sharpen.</p>
<h2>Error Analysis Reveals More Than Accuracy</h2>
<p>The most valuable part of the chapter isn't the accuracy numbers—it's the <strong>error analysis</strong>.</p>
<p>The authors sort validation examples by loss (highest to lowest) and discover:</p>
<p><strong>High-loss examples:</strong>
- Mislabeled data (joy labeled when it's clearly sadness)
- Ambiguous examples that don't fit cleanly into any class
- Edge cases where the model legitimately struggles</p>
<p><strong>Low-loss examples:</strong>
- Model is most confident about predicting "sadness"
- Consistently correct on clear examples
- No obvious exploitation of shortcuts</p>
<p>This is the work that matters. You can't improve what you don't inspect.</p>
<p>Finding mislabeled examples improves the dataset. Understanding ambiguous cases might reveal the need for new classes or better annotation guidelines. Checking low-loss examples ensures the model isn't cheating by exploiting spurious correlations.</p>
<p><strong>The quote that sticks:</strong> "Every process that adds labels to data can be flawed. Annotators can make mistakes or disagree, while labels that are inferred from other features can be wrong."</p>
<p>Data quality limits model performance more often than architecture does.</p>
<h2>The Practical Path</h2>
<p>Here's the workflow the chapter demonstrates:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Load dataset</strong> with Hugging Face Datasets (handles tokenization, batching, caching)</li>
<li><strong>Tokenize</strong> with the pretrained model's tokenizer (subword tokenization via WordPiece)</li>
<li><strong>Try feature extraction first</strong> (freeze model, train simple classifier on hidden states)</li>
<li><strong>If results aren't good enough, fine-tune</strong> (train whole model with Trainer API)</li>
<li><strong>Error analysis</strong> (sort by loss, find mislabeled/ambiguous examples)</li>
<li><strong>Push to Hub</strong> (share model, get inference endpoint for free)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the standard recipe. The only decision point: is feature extraction good enough, or do you need to fine-tune?</p>
<p>For emotion classification on tweets: you need to fine-tune.</p>
<p>For other tasks with cleaner separation or fewer classes, feature extraction might suffice.</p>
<p><strong>The rule:</strong> Try cheap first. Upgrade when results demand it.</p>
<h2>Subword Tokenization Is the Compromise</h2>
<p>The chapter walks through three tokenization strategies:</p>
<p><strong>Character-level:</strong> Treats text as a stream of characters. No vocabulary size problem, but models have to learn words from scratch. Slow to train.</p>
<p><strong>Word-level:</strong> Preserves linguistic structure, but vocabulary explodes (millions of unique words). Out-of-vocabulary words become <code>[UNK]</code>, losing information.</p>
<p><strong>Subword (WordPiece):</strong> Splits rare words into smaller units ("tokenizing" → "token" + "##izing"), keeps frequent words intact. Best of both worlds.</p>
<p>DistilBERT uses WordPiece with a 30,522-token vocabulary. Common words stay whole. Rare words or misspellings get split into recognizable pieces.</p>
<p>This is why transformers generalize better than word-based models—they can handle typos, rare words, and domain-specific terms without expanding the vocabulary.</p>
<h2>Special Tokens Matter</h2>
<p>Every transformer has special tokens that control behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>[CLS]:</strong> Start of sequence, used for classification (hidden state at [CLS] represents the whole input)</li>
<li><strong>[SEP]:</strong> End of sequence, separates segments in multi-part inputs</li>
<li><strong>[PAD]:</strong> Padding to make batches the same length</li>
<li><strong>[MASK]:</strong> Masked tokens during pretraining (not used for classification)</li>
</ul>
<p>The attention mask tells the model which tokens are real and which are padding. Without it, the model would treat padding as meaningful input.</p>
<p><strong>Critical rule:</strong> Always use the same tokenizer that the model was trained with. Switching tokenizers is like shuffling the vocabulary—suddenly "house" means "cat" and everything breaks.</p>
<h2>The 29-Point Gap Is Not Optional</h2>
<p>Feature extraction: 63%. Fine-tuning: 92%.</p>
<p>That gap is not a rounding error. It's the difference between "sort of works" and "ready to deploy."</p>
<p>If you have the compute, fine-tune. If you don't, use feature extraction as a prototype and budget for the real thing.</p>
<p>The tools make this easy—Hugging Face Datasets, Tokenizers, Transformers, and the Trainer API handle all the boilerplate. The hard part isn't code. It's deciding whether 63% is good enough.</p>
<p>Usually, it's not.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <em>Natural Language Processing with Transformers (Revised Edition)</em>, Chapter 2: Text Classification<br />
<strong>Code:</strong> All examples runnable in ~5 minutes with DistilBERT<br />
<strong>Key insight:</strong> The gap between frozen and fine-tuned is not marginal. It's categorical.</p>
