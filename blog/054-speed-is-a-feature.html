        <h1>Speed Is a Feature</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">The OWASP Top 10 for LLMs was built in 8 weeks instead of a year. Here's why that mattered.</p>

        <article>
<p>When Steve Willison started researching LLM security in spring 2023, there was almost nothing organized. Lots of academic papers, scattered blog posts, but no framework. He asked ChatGPT to draft a Top 10 list modeled after OWASP's classic web security framework. Then he sent it to Jeff Williams, the guy who wrote the original OWASP Top 10 back in 2001.</p>
<p>Jeff told him to petition the OWASP board. A few weeks later, the project was approved. Steve posted the announcement on LinkedIn, hoping to find "a dozen or so like-minded individuals."</p>
<p>He got <strong>500 volunteers</strong> in the first week.</p>
<h2>The Typical Timeline vs The Actual Timeline</h2>
<p>A normal OWASP Top 10 list takes over a year to develop. Steve's team did it in <strong>eight weeks</strong>. Not because they cut corners — the final document was comprehensive, well-researched, and immediately became the industry standard. They moved fast because the situation demanded it.</p>
<p>LLMs were exploding. ChatGPT had just launched. Developers were building LLM apps with no idea how to secure them. Waiting a year meant watching thousands of vulnerable systems go into production.</p>
<p>So they didn't wait.</p>
<h2>How They Did It</h2>
<p><strong>Two-week sprints.</strong> Most of the expert team was familiar with Agile development, so they adopted that rhythm. Every sprint had a clear deliverable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sprint 1:</strong> Brainstorming and commentary. Review the 0.1 draft, collect all existing research, build a curated wiki of LLM security resources.</li>
<li><strong>Sprint 2:</strong> Generate version 0.5. Team submitted 43 detailed vulnerability descriptions. Two rounds of voting narrowed it to 10. Published as v0.5.</li>
<li><strong>Sprint 3:</strong> Refine each entry. Created Slack channels per vulnerability, assigned leads, formed subteams of 10-30 people. Merged overlapping entries. Result: v0.9 — <strong>33% shorter than v0.5</strong> (refinement creates focus).</li>
<li><strong>Sprint 4:</strong> Final review, design layout, publish v1.0.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Short brainstorming phase.</strong> Two weeks to throw out ideas, argue on Slack, socialize existing research. Then <strong>stop</strong>. Momentum dies when brainstorming drags on forever.</p>
<p><strong>Core leadership team.</strong> Steve didn't try to manage 500 people. He identified active, knowledgeable members and asked them to join the core team. No special reward — just recognition and being "at the heart of the project." Most said yes immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Visible deliverables every two weeks.</strong> When people disagreed, they acknowledged it and agreed to resolve it in the next sprint. No getting stuck. Version 1.0 shipped with some unresolved questions — that's fine, it's a living document. Getting something useful into developers' hands mattered more than perfection.</p>
<h2>The Result</h2>
<p>Steve's announcement of v1.0 got <strong>40,000 views</strong> on LinkedIn. Media coverage in Wired, SD Times, The Register, Infosecurity Magazine. Government agencies in the US and Europe immediately referenced it as a foundational document.</p>
<p>The reception was "uniformly positive." Not because the list was flawless — everyone agreed there was more to do. But developers were <strong>so hungry for guidance</strong> that a well-researched, clearly written framework hit the mark.</p>
<h2>Why Speed Mattered</h2>
<p>Timing wasn't just luck — it was strategic. The wave of interest following ChatGPT's release created the conditions for this project to succeed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Urgency attracted talent.</strong> People joined because they sensed the importance. LLMs were going into production systems <em>now</em>, not next year.</li>
<li><strong>Clear deadlines kept people motivated.</strong> Seeing a goal that's eight weeks away (not eighteen months) makes people commit time.</li>
<li><strong>Global Zoom meetings every two weeks.</strong> Recordings on YouTube for those who couldn't attend live. Critical for coordinating a distributed team.</li>
<li><strong>Living document mindset.</strong> Version 1.0 doesn't have to be perfect. It has to be useful. You can iterate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What This Teaches</h2>
<p><strong>When the field is moving fast, consensus can't be slow.</strong> A year-long process would have arrived too late. By the time it published, the landscape would have shifted again.</p>
<p><strong>Agile isn't just for software.</strong> Short sprints, visible deliverables, avoiding analysis paralysis — these work for research, standards creation, any collaborative work.</p>
<p><strong>Perfection is the enemy of useful.</strong> The OWASP Top 10 for LLMs shipped with open questions. That's fine. Developers needed <em>something</em>. Refinement happens in public, over time.</p>
<p><strong>Recognition motivates more than reward.</strong> The core team members got no compensation. They got to be part of something important. That was enough.</p>
<hr />
<p>The security vulnerabilities themselves start in Chapter 3. But this chapter — the story of how the framework was built — matters just as much. Because the next time you need expert consensus on something new, you'll know: <strong>speed is a feature, not a bug</strong>.</p>
<p>You just have to design for it.</p>
