        <h1>You Can't Fix What You Can't See</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Supply chain security for LLMs means tracking what you depend on</p>

        <article>
<p>In December 2021, a zero-day vulnerability in Log4j—a Java logging library embedded in millions of applications—let attackers gain full control of vulnerable servers. Within days, botnets, ransomware groups, and state-sponsored hackers were scanning the internet for exposed systems. Wired called it "The Internet Is on Fire."</p>
<p>The vulnerability wasn't sophisticated. Improper input validation allowed crafted requests to execute malicious Java code. What made it catastrophic was <strong>ubiquity</strong>. Log4j was everywhere, and nobody knew where "everywhere" was.</p>
<p>You can't fix what you can't see.</p>
<h2>The Supply Chain Isn't Just Code Anymore</h2>
<p>Traditional software supply chains are well understood: your application depends on libraries, frameworks, services. When a vulnerability is disclosed (like Apache Struts in the 2017 Equifax breach), you check if you use it, patch it, move on.</p>
<p>LLM applications broke that model.</p>
<p>Your supply chain now includes:</p>
<p><strong>1. Foundation models</strong> — You download a pretrained model from Hugging Face. Do you know its provenance? Its training data? Whether someone swapped it out between versions?</p>
<p>In 2023, malicious actors compromised Hugging Face accounts for Meta, Intel, Microsoft, and Google via leaked API tokens. They could have swapped well-trusted models for tainted versions. If you downloaded the model without verification, you'd never know.</p>
<p><strong>2. Training data</strong> — You fine-tune your model on a dataset. Where did it come from? What's in it?</p>
<p>Researchers showed that for $60, they could insert poisoned data into Wikipedia-scale resources that would influence training results. Another study found that LAION-5B—a popular dataset for image generation models like Stable Diffusion—contained over 3,000 images of child sexual abuse material.</p>
<p>If you didn't document your training data, you don't know if you're exposed.</p>
<p><strong>3. RAG sources</strong> — Your LLM queries external APIs, databases, web pages. That data becomes part of your application's behavior. If it's compromised, so are you.</p>
<p><strong>4. Plugins</strong> — OpenAI introduced plugins in 2023 to extend ChatGPT's capabilities (Expedia, Zillow, Instacart). Researchers quickly found they could be used for prompt injection, data theft, malware installation.</p>
<p>Every plugin is a third-party dependency you don't control.</p>
<h2>The Answer Isn't Prevention—It's Visibility</h2>
<p>You can't prevent vulnerabilities from existing in your dependencies. What you can do is <strong>know what your dependencies are</strong>, so when a vulnerability is disclosed, you can act.</p>
<p>Traditional software uses a <strong>Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)</strong>—a comprehensive inventory of every component, library, module in your application. Think of it as an ingredient list for software.</p>
<p>When Log4Shell was disclosed, teams with SBOMs could grep for <code>log4j</code>, find affected systems, patch immediately. Teams without SBOMs spent weeks hunting through code, trying to figure out if they were exposed.</p>
<p>For LLMs, the concept extends:</p>
<p><strong>Model cards</strong> document ML models—their architecture, training data, performance metrics, ethical considerations, intended use cases, limitations. Hugging Face pioneered this format to ensure models are used responsibly.</p>
<p><strong>ML-BOM (Machine Learning Bill of Materials)</strong> is CycloneDX 1.5's extension of the SBOM standard to cover ML components: models, algorithms, datasets, training pipelines, frameworks. It captures provenance, versioning, dependencies, performance metrics.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified ML-BOM for a customer service chatbot:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;bomFormat&quot;: &quot;CycloneDX&quot;,
  &quot;specVersion&quot;: &quot;1.5&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: 1,
  &quot;components&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;application&quot;,
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Customer Service Bot&quot;,
      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
      &quot;externalReferences&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;type&quot;: &quot;vcs&quot;,
          &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1&quot;
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;dataset&quot;,
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Customer Support LLM Chatbot Training Dataset&quot;,
      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
      &quot;licenses&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;license&quot;: {
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Apache 2.0&quot;,
            &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/&quot;
          }
        }
      ],
      &quot;externalReferences&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;type&quot;: &quot;vcs&quot;,
          &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://github.com/bitext/customer-support-dataset&quot;
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>What it gives you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Foundation model tracked (Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1 from Hugging Face)</li>
<li>Training data tracked (customer support dataset from GitHub)</li>
<li>Licenses documented (Apache 2.0)</li>
<li>Version control references (so you can verify provenance)</li>
</ul>
<p>When a vulnerability is disclosed in Mixtral or the training dataset is found to contain problematic content, you know instantly whether you're affected.</p>
<h2>The Future: Provenance, Not Just Inventory</h2>
<p>Tracking what you depend on is step one. The next frontier is proving it hasn't been tampered with.</p>
<p><strong>Digital signing</strong> — Cryptographically sign models with a private key. Anyone can verify the signature with the public key, proving the model came from the expected source and hasn't been altered.</p>
<p><strong>Watermarking</strong> — Embed identifying information directly in the model's weights or architecture. A unique fingerprint that survives duplication. If someone clones or steals your model, the watermark proves its origin.</p>
<p>Together, these techniques authenticate models throughout their lifecycle.</p>
<h2>Vulnerability Databases Are Catching Up</h2>
<p>For traditional software, we have well-established vulnerability tracking:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MITRE CVE</strong> — Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database. Each vulnerability gets a unique CVE ID, a detailed description, a CVSS severity score, suggested mitigations.</li>
<li><strong>NVD</strong> — National Vulnerability Database, integrates with CVE.</li>
</ul>
<p>For AI systems, MITRE launched <strong>ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial Intelligence Systems)</strong>—a framework for understanding adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures specific to AI. It models threats like adversarial attacks (intentionally crafted inputs that manipulate models), data poisoning, model extraction.</p>
<p>As LLMs mature, we'll see more standardized classifications of AI-specific vulnerabilities. The ecosystem is young, but it's moving fast.</p>
<h2>The Lesson</h2>
<p>Supply chain security isn't about eliminating risk. It's about <strong>knowing what you depend on, so you can act when something breaks.</strong></p>
<p>You can't fix what you can't see. Build visibility first. Track your models, your datasets, your plugins, your RAG sources. Document their provenance. Use standard formats (CycloneDX ML-BOM, model cards).</p>
<p>When the next Log4Shell hits—and it will—you'll know exactly where you stand.</p>
