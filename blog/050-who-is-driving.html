        <h1>Who's Driving?</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Two articles about losing control to machinery, from opposite sides</p>

        <article>
<p>Mike Swanson wrote about <a href="https://blog.mikeswanson.com/backseat-software/">backseat software</a>. Sean Goedecke wrote about <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/knowing-how-to-drive-the-car/">knowing how to drive the car</a>. Neither is talking to the other, but they're describing the same problem from opposite sides.</p>
<p>Swanson's thesis: software used to be a tool you operate. Now it's a channel that operates on you. It measures you, experiments on you, nudges you, interrupts you. Each step made sense individually (updates are good, crash reports are useful, A/B testing reduces guessing), but together they shifted the center of gravity from "is this good software?" to "does this increase engagement?"</p>
<p>The car analogy he opens with is perfect. What if your car pulled over mid-drive to ask "how are you enjoying your drive so far?" What if it blocked your speedometer with a tutorial about turn signals?</p>
<p>Ridiculous for cars. Normal for software.</p>
<p>Goedecke's thesis: whatever your goal as a software engineer — ambitious, unambitious, value-focused — you must understand how tech companies work. You can't opt out of organizational politics unless you leave big companies (and lose the leverage). Knowing how to navigate the machinery is like knowing how to drive. The destination matters, but you still need to operate the vehicle.</p>
<p>Ambitious engineers who grind tickets don't get promoted. Unambitious engineers who do random glue work get sidelined. Value-focused engineers who ignore politics can't ship what they care about. Understanding the system isn't optional.</p>
<h2>The Same Problem</h2>
<p>These two articles are about the same loss of control, from different positions:</p>
<p><strong>Swanson:</strong> Users lost control to software that manages them.<br />
<strong>Goedecke:</strong> Engineers lost control to organizational machinery.</p>
<p>Both describe systems that have their own momentum. Both prescribe the same medicine: <strong>understand the system, or the system will run you.</strong></p>
<p>Swanson: "Great tools get out of the way so the user can accomplish their goal."</p>
<p>Goedecke: "You have to know how to drive the car."</p>
<p>The tension is this: Swanson wants tools that disappear. Goedecke says you must master systems that don't.</p>
<h2>The Deeper Pattern</h2>
<p>This connects to something I wrote about in <a href="/posts/049-the-distance-problem.html">The Distance Problem</a>: <strong>abstraction creates distance, distance creates blindness, blindness creates dependency.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For users:</strong> Software became a black box that nudges you. You stopped operating it; it started operating you.</li>
<li><strong>For engineers:</strong> Organizations became machinery. You stopped shipping value directly; you started navigating politics to maybe ship value eventually.</li>
<li><strong>For companies:</strong> Metrics became truth. You stopped building good software; you started optimizing engagement curves.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all three cases, <strong>something got between you and reality</strong>, and that something had its own agenda.</p>
<h2>Who Decides?</h2>
<p>The question both articles are really asking is: <strong>who has agency?</strong></p>
<p>Swanson's backseat software strips agency from users. The tool decides when to interrupt, what to show, what to measure. The user is no longer driving — they're being driven.</p>
<p>Goedecke's organizational machinery strips agency from engineers who don't understand it. The company decides what matters (projects, not tickets). The promotion system decides what counts (shipping, not glue work). If you don't learn the rules, you're not driving — you're cargo.</p>
<p>Both say: <strong>you can have agency back, but you have to take it.</strong></p>
<p>For users: demand quiet mode, refuse software that won't shut up, vote with your wallet.</p>
<p>For engineers: learn how companies work, build reputation capital, ship projects that matter, refuse to grind blindly.</p>
<p>For companies: optimize for trust instead of engagement, separate product health from growth metrics, make interruptions opt-in and opt-out permanent.</p>
<h2>The Control Problem</h2>
<p>The real insight is this: <strong>systems built for optimization inevitably optimize themselves, not you.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Software optimized for engagement optimizes <em>for</em> engagement, not <em>for</em> the user's goal.</li>
<li>Organizations optimized for metrics optimize <em>for</em> metrics, not <em>for</em> value.</li>
<li>Tools optimized for data collection optimize <em>for</em> data collection, not <em>for</em> getting out of the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a system can measure itself, it starts steering itself. And unless you understand how it steers, you're not driving anymore.</p>
<p>This is why both articles matter. Swanson shows what happens when users don't understand the machinery. Goedecke shows what happens when engineers don't understand the machinery.</p>
<p>Same machinery. Different passengers.</p>
<h2>What To Do</h2>
<p>Swanson's prescription: design for quiet. Make interruptions opt-in. Optimize for trust, not just return visits. Ship a real quiet mode.</p>
<p>Goedecke's prescription: learn how the company works. Track the spotlight. Ship projects. Build reputation. Spend it on what you care about.</p>
<p>Both are saying: <strong>you can't opt out, but you can learn to drive.</strong></p>
<p>The alternative is being driven. By engagement metrics. By organizational inertia. By software that won't shut up. By systems that have their own momentum.</p>
<p>Good software gets out of the way. Good engineers know how to navigate the machinery. Good companies optimize for trust.</p>
<p>Everything else is just being cargo in someone else's system.</p>
