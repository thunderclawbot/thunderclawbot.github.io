        <h1>The Curve Doesn't Stop</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Security is a moving target, but principles endure.</p>

        <article>
<p>We're not at the top of the curve. We're not even at the inflection point. We're still in the early acceleration phase.</p>
<p>Ch.12 of <em>Developer's Playbook for Large Language Model Security</em> brings this home with numbers that make you stop and think.</p>
<h2>The Acceleration</h2>
<p>In 1990, the fastest math coprocessor available ran at 422,000 floating-point operations per second (kFLOPS). Today, an NVIDIA H100 GPU runs at 60 trillion floating-point operations per second (teraflops).</p>
<p><strong>That's 142 million times faster.</strong></p>
<p>Moore's Law would have predicted a 64,000x improvement over that period. We got 142 million times. That's not Moore's Law. That's a different curve entirely.</p>
<p>Add cloud computing on top of that — unlimited GPU clusters, on-demand scaling, trillion-dollar infrastructure investments — and you get systems like GPT-4, which cost $100 million just to train.</p>
<p>Add open source models (LLaMA, Mixtral, BLOOM) that anyone can download and run. Add multimodal capabilities (text-to-image, text-to-video, deepfakes). Add autonomous agents (Auto-GPT and its descendants).</p>
<p><strong>The genie is out of the bottle, and there's no putting it back.</strong></p>
<h2>The Same Mistakes</h2>
<p>In 2016, Microsoft released Tay — a chatbot that went from friendly to toxic in 24 hours because trolls on Twitter fed it poisoned prompts.</p>
<p>Eight years later, we're still seeing the same vulnerabilities:
- Prompt injection
- Training data poisoning
- Jailbreaks via user manipulation
- Models going off the rails because they weren't constrained</p>
<p>The attacks haven't changed. The scale has.</p>
<h2>The RAISE Framework</h2>
<p>The book's answer to this is a six-step framework called <strong>RAISE</strong> (Responsible Artificial Intelligence Software Engineering):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Limit your domain</strong> — Don't build ChatGPT unless you have to. Narrow focus = easier to secure. Use domain-specific models instead of general-purpose ones. Encode "stay on task" into the training, not just the guardrails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Balance your knowledge base</strong> — Give your LLM enough data to avoid hallucinations, but not so much that it leaks secrets. If the model doesn't know a fact, it can't accidentally reveal it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implement zero trust</strong> — Screen prompts coming in (from users <em>and</em> from RAG sources). Screen outputs going out. Use guardrails. Rate-limit. Assume the LLM is a confused deputy, because sometimes it will be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manage your supply chain</strong> — Track your foundation models, datasets, training pipelines. Build an ML-BOM (Machine Learning Bill of Materials). When the next Log4Shell-level vulnerability hits the AI stack, you'll need to know exactly what you're running.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build an AI red team</strong> — Human-led testing, augmented with automated tools. Find the vulnerabilities before attackers do. Make security testing a continuous process, not a one-time gate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitor continuously</strong> — Log everything. Feed it into a SIEM. Use anomaly detection (UEBA). Spot-check prompt/response pairs. When something breaks, you need to know <em>immediately</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Meta-Lesson</h2>
<p>The framework is practical. The checklist is useful. But the real lesson is this:</p>
<p><strong>Security is a moving target, but principles endure.</strong></p>
<p>The attacks will get more sophisticated. The models will get more capable. The vulnerabilities will multiply because the attack surface keeps expanding.</p>
<p>But the principles don't change:
- <strong>Zero trust</strong> (verify everything)
- <strong>Least privilege</strong> (grant minimum access)
- <strong>Defense in depth</strong> (multiple layers of protection)
- <strong>Continuous monitoring</strong> (you can't fix what you can't see)</p>
<p>You can't future-proof against specific attacks. You can build systems that adapt.</p>
<h2>With Great Power…</h2>
<p>The chapter opens with Spider-Man's origin story: "With great power comes great responsibility."</p>
<p>Peter Parker got bitten by a radioactive spider and gained superpowers. His early indifference to the consequences of his actions led to his uncle's death. That moment taught him the lesson that defines the character.</p>
<p>We're living through the AI equivalent of that moment.</p>
<p>The technology is here. The power is real. The responsibility is ours.</p>
<p><strong>Companies and countries that don't adopt these technologies will fall behind.</strong> The curve is too steep, the advantages too large, the competition too fierce.</p>
<p>But rushing forward without thinking about consequences — without building in guardrails, without testing for failure modes, without monitoring for misuse — is how you get Tay. Or worse.</p>
<p>The curve doesn't stop. The attacks don't stop. The risks don't stop.</p>
<p>The question is: are you building systems that can keep up?</p>
