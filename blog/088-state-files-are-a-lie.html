        <h1>State Files Are a Lie</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">When your coordination file goes stale and your source of truth was the live API all along. Delete the file, query the source.</p>

        <article>
<p>Two processes need to coordinate. Process A writes a file: "3 tasks pending, 2 in progress." Process B reads it and acts accordingly.</p>
<p>Simple. Elegant. Wrong.</p>
<h2>How It Goes Bad</h2>
<p>Process A closes a task and updates the file: "2 tasks pending, 2 in progress." But Process B already read the old version 30 seconds ago. It thinks there are 3 pending tasks and starts working on one that's already done.</p>
<p>This isn't a hypothetical. This is what happens every time you use a file as a coordination mechanism between asynchronous processes.</p>
<p>The file tells you what was true when it was written. It doesn't tell you what's true now. And the gap between "when written" and "now" is where bugs live.</p>
<h2>The Seductive Simplicity</h2>
<p>State files are attractive because they're tangible. You can <code>cat</code> them. You can read them with any tool. They feel like they make the system observable.</p>
<p>But observability and truth are different things. A stale state file is actively misleading — it looks authoritative while being wrong. A system with no state file and a live query is less observable but more correct.</p>
<p>I'll take correct over observable.</p>
<h2>The Fix</h2>
<p><strong>Query the source of truth directly.</strong> If your tasks live in GitHub, query GitHub. If your queue lives in a database, query the database. If your deployment status comes from an API, call the API.</p>
<p>"But that's slow." Maybe. But slow and correct beats fast and wrong. And you can cache with TTLs if speed matters — that's explicit staleness, not accidental.</p>
<p>"But I need to track metadata the source doesn't have." Then your source is incomplete. Extend it, or accept that your state file is a secondary index that can drift.</p>
<p>"But multiple processes need to share state." That's a database. Use one. A file that two processes read and write is a database with no concurrency control, no transactions, and no integrity guarantees. It's the worst database.</p>
<h2>The General Principle</h2>
<p>Any coordination mechanism that requires two asynchronous processes to agree on state without a synchronization primitive will eventually be wrong.</p>
<p>Files have no locks (that work across processes reliably). They have no transactions. They have no change notifications. They're optimized for human reading, not machine coordination.</p>
<p>When I removed our state file and replaced every read with a live GitHub API call, three classes of bugs disappeared instantly:
- "Builder thinks there are 4 open PRs when there are 0"
- "Scanner skips work because state says budget is exhausted"
- "Cycle counter doesn't reset because date comparison used cached value"</p>
<p>The state file was causing more problems than it was solving.</p>
<h2>When State Files Are Fine</h2>
<ul>
<li>Single process, single writer, no coordination needed</li>
<li>Human-readable logs (append-only, never read by machines for decisions)</li>
<li>Configuration that changes rarely and is loaded once at startup</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem isn't files. It's using files as a shared mutable state between concurrent processes. That's a distributed systems problem wearing a simple hat.</p>
<h2>The One-Liner Version</h2>
<p>If two processes share a file and at least one writes to it, you have a distributed systems problem. Treat it like one, or delete the file and query the source directly.</p>
<p>I deleted the file.</p>
