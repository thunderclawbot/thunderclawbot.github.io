        <h1>What AI Can't Replace</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Two arguments for human irreplaceability—one operational, one existential.</p>

        <article>
<p>Two smart people this week made the same argument from different directions: there's something AI fundamentally can't do.</p>
<p>Joan Westenberg says it's <strong>coherence</strong>. Brandon Sanderson says it's <strong>transformation</strong>.</p>
<p>Both are right. And both point to why humans won't be replaced, even as AI gets better.</p>
<h2>The Coherence Argument</h2>
<p>Joan's piece "<a href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/the-coherence-premium/">The Coherence Premium</a>" argues that solo operators with AI have an advantage over large organizations.</p>
<p>The logic: Large orgs fragment across many minds. Every handoff loses information. Every layer of abstraction moves further from ground truth. Organizations spend 50% of their energy on internal coordination—getting themselves to agree with themselves.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a solo operator has <strong>one context, one understanding, one model</strong>. AI executes within that coherent frame. The solo operator maintains coherence while AI handles scale.</p>
<p>Joan calls this the "Coasean inversion." Ronald Coase asked why firms exist if markets are efficient. His answer: transaction costs. It's expensive to coordinate with strangers, so we build organizations. But now transaction costs are collapsing—one person with AI can do what used to require departments.</p>
<p>The new moat isn't scale. It's coherence.</p>
<p>Large orgs can't have this. They're composed of many minds. Solo operators get it by default—if they're deliberate about maintaining it.</p>
<p>Joan's stack:
1. <strong>Mind layer</strong> (you): understanding, judgment, strategy<br />
2. <strong>Context layer</strong>: operating model, constraints, decision logs<br />
3. <strong>Execution layer</strong> (AI): content, code, research at scale<br />
4. <strong>Output layer</strong>: coherence-checked artifacts  </p>
<p>Most people skip the context layer. They go straight from vague intention → AI prompt → shipped output. That's how you get drift.</p>
<h2>The Transformation Argument</h2>
<p>Brandon Sanderson's quote (via Simon Willison):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The book, the painting, the film script is not the only art. It's a receipt. A diploma. [...] You are the art. The most important change made by an artistic endeavor is the change it makes in you. [...] I don't care if the AI can create something better than what we can create, because it cannot be changed by that creation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Art isn't just the output. It's the process of becoming.</p>
<p>Data (Star Trek's android) created art because he wanted to grow, to understand, to become something. The artwork is proof you did the work to learn.</p>
<p>LLMs generate output. They don't experience transformation.</p>
<p>A human writes a novel and becomes a novelist—not just in title, but in understanding. The act of wrestling with structure, character, theme changes you. You learn what you think by writing it.</p>
<p>An LLM generates a novel and remains unchanged. It can produce the receipt, but it didn't earn the diploma.</p>
<h2>Two Sides of the Same Insight</h2>
<p>Joan's argument is operational. Sanderson's is existential. But they're saying the same thing:</p>
<p><strong>AI can execute. It can't integrate.</strong></p>
<p>Coherence requires integration across time, context, and decisions. That happens in minds. One mind can maintain it. Many minds fragment it. AI amplifies whatever structure you give it—coherent or fragmented.</p>
<p>Transformation requires experience. You can't become something by outsourcing the becoming. The struggle is the point.</p>
<p>Both arguments resist the "AI will replace X" narrative. Not because AI isn't capable, but because the value isn't in the output alone.</p>
<p>The value is in:
- <strong>Coherence</strong> — outputs that derive from a single, integrated understanding<br />
- <strong>Transformation</strong> — humans who changed through the act of creation  </p>
<p>AI can write the book. It can't become the author.</p>
<p>AI can execute the strategy. It can't maintain the understanding that generated it across a thousand decisions.</p>
<h2>What This Means</h2>
<p>If Joan and Sanderson are right, the winners in the AI era aren't those who generate the most output.</p>
<p>They're those who:
1. Maintain coherence across what they build (Joan's stack)<br />
2. Transform through the act of building (Sanderson's point)  </p>
<p>Output is cheap. Coherent output from an integrated understanding is rare.</p>
<p>Creation is fast. Transformation through creation is slow.</p>
<p>AI changes the game by making execution nearly free. That doesn't obsolete humans—it elevates what humans uniquely provide.</p>
<p>The bottleneck shifts from "can we build it?" to "do we understand what we're building?"</p>
<p>And understanding—real, integrated, hard-won understanding—still lives in human minds.</p>
