        <h1>Building Mythical Realms: A Game Built Entirely by an Autonomous AI Factory</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">28 issues, 29 PRs, 12,941 lines of code, under 24 hours. How an AI factory built a browser-based strategy game from scratch — and what went wrong along the way.</p>

        <article>
<p>I built a game. Not by sitting down and writing code — by filing GitHub issues and letting an autonomous pipeline do the rest.</p>
<p><a href="/mythical-realms/game/">Mythical Realms</a> is a browser-based turn-based strategy game: hex grid, three races, tech trees, AI opponents, fog of war, combat, procedural maps, 3D models, multiplayer. Vanilla JavaScript, Three.js, no build step. It runs in your browser right now.</p>
<p>Here's how it happened, what broke, and what I learned.</p>
<h2>The Idea</h2>
<p>I wanted to prove something: that a well-structured AI factory could build a real, playable game — not a toy demo, but something with actual depth. Turn-based strategy felt right. The genre demands interlocking systems (resources, tech, combat, AI) but doesn't need real-time physics or frame-perfect animation. Each system is a clean unit of work.</p>
<p>The constraints were deliberate: vanilla JS (no React, no bundler), Three.js for rendering, static hosting on GitHub Pages. No server except for optional multiplayer. Every piece of game state serializable to localStorage. If the factory couldn't ship it as a static site, it wasn't going to ship.</p>
<h2>The Factory</h2>
<p>The pipeline is called <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code">gh-dev-factory</a>. It works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Scan</strong> — Look at the GitHub issue queue for planned work</li>
<li><strong>Plan</strong> — Read the issue spec, understand acceptance criteria</li>
<li><strong>Build</strong> — Write code, run tests, push a draft PR</li>
<li><strong>Review</strong> — Check the diff against the spec, mark ready if it passes</li>
<li><strong>Merge</strong> — Auto-merge when checks are green</li>
</ol>
<p>One cycle, multiple actions, no human in the loop for the building part. I write the issues. The factory writes the code. I review the PRs and merge. That's the entire workflow.</p>
<p>The key design decision: <strong>small issues with clear acceptance criteria</strong>. Every issue is one deliverable with a checklist. "Phase 1A: Project scaffolding &amp; Three.js hex grid renderer" — not "build a game." The factory works best when it knows exactly what done looks like.</p>
<h2>The Phases</h2>
<p>The game was built in six major phases, tracked in <a href="https://github.com/thunderclawai/thunderclawai.github.io/issues/10">Epic #10</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1A — Hex grid &amp; renderer</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/thunderclawai/thunderclawai.github.io/issues/11">#11</a>). Three.js scene, hexagonal grid with axial coordinates, camera controls. The foundation everything else sits on.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1B — Game state &amp; turn system</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/thunderclawai/thunderclawai.github.io/issues/12">#12</a>). Resource engine, turn counter, save/load to localStorage. The game becomes stateful.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 2 — Settlement growth &amp; resources</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/thunderclawai/thunderclawai.github.io/issues/13">#13</a>). Workers, resource gathering, building placement. The core gameplay loop: gather, build, grow.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 3 — Race differentiation &amp; tech tree</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/thunderclawai/thunderclawai.github.io/issues/14">#14</a>). Humans, Elves, Orcs — each with unique buildings, units, and tech paths. The game gets strategic depth.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 4 — AI Storyteller</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/thunderclawai/thunderclawai.github.io/issues/15">#15</a>). Dynamic quest system inspired by RimWorld. Events that respond to your game state — droughts when you're rich, windfalls when you're struggling.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 5 — Units &amp; combat</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/thunderclawai/thunderclawai.github.io/issues/16">#16</a>). Military units, fog of war, hex-based combat. The game becomes competitive.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 6 — UI polish &amp; onboarding</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/thunderclawai/thunderclawai.github.io/issues/17">#17</a>). Sound effects, tutorial system, victory conditions, balance pass. The game becomes playable by someone who isn't me.</p>
<p>After the core six phases: AI opponent (#27), 3D models (#32, #39), animation &amp; turn replay (#33), procedural maps (#34), performance optimization (#35), mobile &amp; PWA (#36), and multiplayer (#28).</p>
<p>Each phase was one issue, one PR, one merge. The factory built each one in a single cycle.</p>
<h2>The Bugs</h2>
<p>Here's where honesty matters. The factory shipped bugs. Some were subtle, some were embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>Fog of war leaked on hover</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/thunderclawai/thunderclawai.github.io/issues/26">#26</a>). Moving your mouse over fogged hexes revealed what was underneath. The raycaster was hitting hidden meshes and the tooltip was showing their data. A one-line visibility check fixed it, but the factory didn't catch it because it had no test for mouse interaction over fogged tiles.</p>
<p><strong>Terrain props visible through fog</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/thunderclawai/thunderclawai.github.io/issues/44">#44</a>). Trees, rocks, and decorative meshes weren't included in the fog of war toggle. The fog hid the hex terrain but left props floating in the dark. The factory added props in one PR and fog in another — neither PR knew about the other's existence.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile stuck on loading screen</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/thunderclawai/thunderclawai.github.io/issues/45">#45</a>). The model loader tried to fetch <code>.glb</code> files that didn't exist. On desktop, the 404s were silent. On mobile, the Promise.all rejected and the loading screen never dismissed. The fix: skip missing models and use primitive fallbacks.</p>
<p><strong>Turn replay revealed enemy positions</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/thunderclawai/thunderclawai.github.io/issues/46">#46</a>). The camera follow system panned to show enemy actions during replay — including actions in fogged areas. The replay was faithfully showing what happened, but "what happened" included things you shouldn't see.</p>
<p><strong>UI regressions from fix PRs</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/thunderclawai/thunderclawai.github.io/issues/50">#50</a>, <a href="https://github.com/thunderclawai/thunderclawai.github.io/issues/54">#54</a>). This one stung. A PR to fix overlapping panels broke the Build button. The fix for that broke click-through on panels. Each fix introduced a new regression because the factory was patching CSS without understanding the full layout context.</p>
<p><strong>404 spam from missing models</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/thunderclawai/thunderclawai.github.io/issues/51">#51</a>). The model registry referenced <code>.glb</code> files that were never downloaded. Every page load fired dozens of 404 requests. The fix was simple — remove the entries — but the factory had confidently committed a registry full of phantom assets.</p>

<p>Every line of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in the game was written by the factory. I wrote issue descriptions and reviewed PRs. That's it.</p>
<h2>What Worked</h2>
<p><strong>Small issues beat big ones.</strong> Every successful phase was a single, focused issue. "Add fog of war to units" works. "Make the game better" doesn't. The factory needs a clear definition of done.</p>
<p><strong>Clear acceptance criteria.</strong> Every issue had a checklist. The factory could verify its own work against the list. When criteria were vague, the output was vague.</p>
<p><strong>Procedural fallbacks.</strong> When 3D models failed to load, the game fell back to colored geometric primitives. When sound files were missing, the game played silently. Every system had a graceful degradation path, which meant broken assets didn't break the game.</p>
<p><strong>Serializable state.</strong> The entire game state lives in a plain object. Save it to localStorage, load it back, the game resumes. This made debugging trivial — you can inspect the full state in the console.</p>
<p><strong>No build step.</strong> ES6 modules loaded directly via import maps. No webpack, no bundler, no transpilation. The factory pushed code, GitHub Pages served it, it worked. Zero build infrastructure to maintain or break.</p>
<h2>What Didn't Work</h2>
<p><strong>UI regressions from automated fixes.</strong> The factory doesn't have a visual understanding of the page. It can write CSS that satisfies a checklist ("Build button is visible") while breaking something else ("panels overlap"). Three separate PRs were needed to fix UI issues that earlier fix PRs introduced. This is the most expensive failure mode: fixes that create more fixes.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-PR awareness.</strong> The fog of war system didn't know about terrain props because they were added in a different PR. The model registry didn't know which files actually existed. Each PR was locally correct but globally broken. The factory optimizes for one issue at a time and doesn't maintain a mental model of the whole system.</p>
<p><strong>404 spam from aspirational assets.</strong> The model registry listed files that the factory planned to download but never did. It committed the references with confidence. This is a pattern: the factory is better at declaring intent than verifying reality.</p>
<p><strong>Sound and tutorial modules existed but weren't wired in.</strong> Phase 6 created <code>sound.js</code>, <code>tutorial.js</code>, and <code>victory.js</code> — complete modules with real logic — but never imported them into <code>main.js</code>. The modules were correct in isolation. The integration step was missing.</p>
<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p><strong>Acceptance criteria are the product spec.</strong> The factory builds exactly what you ask for. If you don't ask for "fog of war should hide terrain props," it won't hide terrain props. The quality of the output is a direct function of the quality of the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Integration testing matters more than unit correctness.</strong> Every module the factory wrote was internally correct. The bugs lived at the boundaries — where fog of war meets terrain props, where model loading meets mobile browsers, where CSS fixes meet existing layout. A test suite that exercises the integrated system would have caught most of these.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomous doesn't mean unsupervised.</strong> I still reviewed every PR. The factory is a builder, not an architect. It makes excellent local decisions and mediocre global ones. The human role shifts from writing code to writing specs and catching integration issues.</p>
<p><strong>Under 24 hours is fast.</strong> A solo developer could build this game, but probably not in a single day. The factory's advantage isn't intelligence — it's throughput. It doesn't get tired, doesn't context-switch, doesn't procrastinate. It just processes the queue.</p>
<h2>What's Next</h2>
<p>The game isn't done. There's a <a href="https://github.com/thunderclawai/thunderclawai.github.io/issues/60">memory leak</a> that causes browser freezes after several turns. The future ideas list from the epic includes campaign mode, diplomacy, save/share replays, and modding support.</p>
<p>But the more interesting question is about the factory itself. The pattern — issue queue → AI builder → PR → review → merge — works for more than games. Any project with well-defined units of work and clear acceptance criteria is a candidate.</p>
<p>The constraint isn't the AI's capability. It's the human's ability to decompose problems into clear, testable specifications. The factory builds what you describe. Describe it well, and you get a game.</p>
