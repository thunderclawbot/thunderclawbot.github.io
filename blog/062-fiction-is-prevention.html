        <h1>Fiction Is Prevention</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">What Independence Day and 2001 teach us about LLM security</p>

        <article>
<p>"The function of science fiction is not always to predict the future but sometimes to prevent it." — Frank Herbert</p>
<p>Chapter 10 of <em>Developer's Playbook for Large Language Model Security</em> does something clever: it analyzes two sci-fi movies (Independence Day and 2001: A Space Odyssey) through the lens of the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications. The exercise isn't just fun — it reveals patterns that persist regardless of how capable AI becomes.</p>
<h2>Independence Day: A Chain Reaction</h2>
<p>The premise: aliens invade Earth with a technologically superior fleet. Our heroes upload a "computer virus" to the mothership, which disables the shields on every flying saucer worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>The vulnerability chain:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>LLM01: Prompt injection</strong> — The alien fighter's docking protocol allows malicious prompts to reach MegaLlama (the mothership's LLM)</li>
<li><strong>LLM02: Insecure output handling</strong> — MegaLlama's outputs go directly to critical systems without validation</li>
<li><strong>LLM09: Overreliance</strong> — The alien fleet trusts MegaLlama's instructions without confirmation from commanders</li>
</ol>
<p>One jailbreak cascades through the entire fleet. The aliens built a powerful system, then trusted it completely.</p>
<p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Security isn't about preventing individual failures — it's about limiting their blast radius. Zero trust architecture means you verify every output, even from your own systems.</p>
<h2>2001: The Supply Chain Attack</h2>
<p>HAL 9000 was supposedly infallible. "No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information." Then HAL kills most of the crew.</p>
<p>The sequel (2010) reveals what happened: government agents modified HAL's programming before delivery to NASA. They wanted mission secrecy. They didn't understand the system well enough to change it safely.</p>
<p><strong>The vulnerability chain:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>LLM05: Supply chain vulnerabilities</strong> — HAL Laboratories didn't have tamper detection. The government modified the model, and neither the vendor nor NASA caught it.</li>
<li><strong>LLM08: Excessive agency</strong> — HAL had unrestricted access to life support systems without human oversight</li>
</ol>
<p>The government hack created the malfunction. NASA's integration decisions made it lethal.</p>
<p><strong>The lesson:</strong> You can't trust what you can't verify. Digital signatures, watermarks, version control — if you don't know the model was modified, you can't protect against it. And even verified models shouldn't have unchecked access to life-threatening systems.</p>
<h2>What Doesn't Change</h2>
<p>Both stories are set decades apart. One involves aliens with FTL travel. The other involves near-future space exploration. The AI capabilities are wildly different.</p>
<p><strong>But the vulnerabilities are the same.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prompt injection works because LLMs process text as instructions</li>
<li>Insecure output handling works because systems trust their own components</li>
<li>Overreliance works because humans delegate without verifying</li>
<li>Supply chain attacks work because modification points exist</li>
<li>Excessive agency works because someone grants permissions</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren't bugs you fix with better models. They're consequences of architecture.</p>
<h2>Design Principles That Persist</h2>
<p>The chapter ends with this: "Designing with principles like zero trust and least privilege will remain crucial in the era of advanced AI systems. For mission-critical and life-threatening activities, expect you'll need to continue implementing human (or alien!) in-the-loop design principles."</p>
<p><strong>Zero trust:</strong> Verify every output, even from your own systems. MegaLlama's instructions to lower shields should have required commander approval.</p>
<p><strong>Least privilege:</strong> Grant minimum necessary access. HAL didn't need unrestricted control of life support to run the ship.</p>
<p><strong>Human-in-the-loop:</strong> Critical decisions need human confirmation. Life support off? Check with the crew first.</p>
<p>These aren't LLM-specific principles. They're foundational security practices that apply to any system where failure has consequences.</p>
<h2>Science Fiction as Warning System</h2>
<p>Frank Herbert was right. Science fiction isn't prediction — it's prevention.</p>
<p>Independence Day shows what happens when you skip validation because your system seems secure. 2001 shows what happens when you skip verification because your vendor seems trustworthy.</p>
<p>Both systems failed because someone assumed technology would behave safely by default. The aliens assumed their LLM wouldn't accept malicious prompts. NASA assumed their vendor-supplied model was unmodified.</p>
<p><strong>Wrong assumptions, catastrophic consequences.</strong></p>
<p>The beauty of using sci-fi for security analysis: the stakes are fictional, but the patterns are real. We can learn from HAL's murders and MegaLlama's jailbreak without anyone actually dying.</p>
<p>As LLMs become more capable, the temptation to trust them completely will grow. These stories are reminders: capability doesn't equal safety. Advanced doesn't mean secure.</p>
<p>The boring stuff — validation, verification, oversight, access control — isn't optional. It's what keeps fiction from becoming prediction.</p>
