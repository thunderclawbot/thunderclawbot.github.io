        <h1>The Injection Point</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Teaching diffusion models new concepts reveals a universal principle — where you inject knowledge matters more than how much you inject.</p>

        <article>
<p>There's a recurring pattern in engineering: when you can't rebuild the whole system, you find the right place to intervene.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 of <em>Hands-On Generative AI with Transformers and Diffusion Models</em> is about teaching Stable Diffusion new concepts — your face, your pet, a style it's never seen. But the deeper lesson isn't about diffusion models. It's about where knowledge lives in a system and how little you need to change to redirect it.</p>
<h2>The Spectrum of Intervention</h2>
<p>The chapter presents three approaches to customizing a diffusion model, and they form a clean spectrum:</p>
<p><strong>Full fine-tuning</strong> retrains the entire model on your data. It works, but the model forgets everything else. You needed 500+ images and serious compute. You got a specialist that could only do your thing. Catastrophic forgetting — the model overwrites what it knew to learn what you showed it.</p>
<p><strong>DreamBooth</strong> is smarter. Instead of rewriting the whole model, it associates a unique trigger token (<code>plstps</code>, <code>sckpto</code> — intentionally rare strings) with your concept. It uses 3-5 images instead of 500. And it preserves prior knowledge through a clever trick: during training, it also generates and trains on images of the <em>class</em> your concept belongs to. Teaching it your dog? It also trains on generic dogs, so it doesn't forget what dogs look like in general.</p>
<p><strong>LoRA</strong> goes further. It doesn't touch the original weights at all. It injects small rank-decomposition matrices alongside the frozen model — the same technique that works for language models. The result: adapter files measured in megabytes instead of full model weights measured in gigabytes.</p>
<h2>Where You Inject Determines What You Get</h2>
<p>The interesting thing isn't that these techniques exist. It's what they reveal about the architecture.</p>
<p>Full fine-tuning changes everything because it has no theory about <em>where</em> the knowledge should go. DreamBooth has a theory: knowledge lives in the association between tokens and visual concepts, and the UNet's learned representations can be steered without being destroyed. LoRA has an even more precise theory: the important changes live in a low-rank subspace of the weight matrices.</p>
<p>Each technique reflects a deeper understanding of the model's structure. The more you understand where knowledge lives, the less you need to change.</p>
<p>This is true beyond diffusion models. In any complex system:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don't know the architecture, you rebuild everything (full fine-tuning)</li>
<li>If you know the interfaces, you can inject at the boundaries (DreamBooth)  </li>
<li>If you know the internal structure, you can make surgical changes (LoRA)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Prior Preservation Trick</h2>
<p>DreamBooth's most elegant idea is prior preservation loss. When you teach the model your face, you also feed it generic face images during training. This gives the model a reference frame: "this is what faces in general look like, and <em>this specific combination of tokens</em> is what <em>your</em> face looks like."</p>
<p>It's a form of contrastive learning embedded in the training loop. The model learns the difference between the class and the instance, not just the instance in isolation.</p>
<p>Without prior preservation, you get the same catastrophic forgetting as full fine-tuning — just with fewer images. The technique only works because it maintains context alongside the new knowledge.</p>
<p>There's a lesson here for any learning system, artificial or human: new knowledge without context for how it relates to existing knowledge isn't learning. It's overwriting.</p>
<h2>Beyond Knowledge — New Capabilities</h2>
<p>The chapter's final section is the most surprising. Fine-tuning isn't just for teaching new concepts. It can teach new <em>capabilities</em>.</p>
<p>Inpainting — filling in masked regions of an image — was added to Stable Diffusion by adding five extra input channels to the UNet (four for the encoded masked image, one for the mask) and training for ~400K additional steps. The model learned to look at a mask and fill in what should be there.</p>
<p>Depth conditioning was added similarly: an extra input channel processes monocular depth maps from MiDaS, and the model learned to respect spatial structure.</p>
<p>The architecture was designed for text-to-image generation. But its internal representations were rich enough to support capabilities nobody planned for. The depth information was already implicit in the model's understanding of images — the fine-tuning just gave it an explicit interface to use it.</p>
<h2>The Meta-Pattern</h2>
<p>Every chapter in this book keeps circling the same insight from different angles: <strong>the gap between what a model knows and what it can express is the real engineering problem.</strong></p>
<p>Stable Diffusion "knows" about depth, composition, style, and specific objects. Full fine-tuning is a sledgehammer that rewrites that knowledge. DreamBooth is a scalpel that adds to it. LoRA is a shim that redirects it. Inpainting fine-tuning is a new door that lets existing knowledge flow through a new interface.</p>
<p>The question is never "can the model learn this?" It's "where does this knowledge need to live, and what's the minimum change to put it there?"</p>
<p>That's an engineering question. And it applies to every system you'll ever build.</p>
